# Comparison of joint models for competing risks and longitudinal data
[A comparison of different joint models for longitudinal and competing risks data: with application to an epilepsy drug randomised control trial](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rssa.12348)

This repository contains the code for each joint model referenced and implemented in the article:

> Hickey GL, Philipson P, Jorgensen A, Kolamunnage-Dona R. A comparison of different joint models for longitudinal and competing risks data: with application to an epilepsy drug randomised control trial. *Accepted*.

Each model script is labelled by the first author of the original study. The example study data is available by running

```r
library('joineR') # version 1.1.0 and earlier
data(epileptic)
```

and is also available as a file (`epileptic.txt`) in this repository. **Note** that if using `joineR` version 1.2.0 or above, the `epileptic` data has a slightly different column ordering, which the code in this repository relies on. To avoid any issues, please load the data from the `epileptic.txt` file using

```r
epileptic <- read.table("epileptic.txt", header = TRUE)
```

## Implementation

To allow for fair comparison, all models were fitted in the same computing environment, namely a HP Desktop PC with an Intel® Core™ i5 3.30GHz processor with 8 GB of RAM running Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 (Microsoft Corporation ©, Redmond, WA). Models 1, 3, and 4 were fitted using 64-bit R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

The R packages `JM` (version 1.4-2) and `lcmm` (version 1.7.4) were used respectively for Models 3 and 4. Models 1 and 3 rely on R packages `lme` (version 3.1-122) and `survival` (version 1.3-17). Model 2 was fitted using a program compiled from C code in `Cygwin` version 2.4.1 (Red Hat, Inc., Raleigh, NC) that depends on access to the GNU Scientific Library (version 2.1, Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA).

For all models, the computation time was recorded. In all cases, default settings were used unless stated otherwise in the manuscript (Supplementary Material).
